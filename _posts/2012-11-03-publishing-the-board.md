Now Sketchboard.Me provides possibility to publish a board. The published board can be embedded into your website.

Select the Publish menu item.

Copy the Embed code and paste it into your web page.

Below you can see the embedded board. Click the image and you can start to edit it. Board is opened in Sketchboard.Me. For security reasons, the board is automatically password protected and password protection is required before publishing. Idea is to make it as easy as possible to reedit the diagram and still have it safe from unwanted modifications.

Published image is not automatically regenerated when the board is changed. Therefore snapshot of the board needs to be republished, before it is available through the embed code. This also allows you to control what is published and when you want to publish a snapshot of the board.

**NOTE!** When you download the board as an image it will also update the published image.
