Reuse diagrams by copying the current board as a new board. Select “Copy Board” and a new board is created for you. This gives you a possibility to create alternative designs. Continue only with the one that is better and ditch the other one. You can even create your own diagram template library.

Location of the copy board button depends whether you are logged in or not. When you are logged in you can copy the board from the switch board list.

When you are not logged in, copy button is directly available from the toolbar. Reasons for different locations are that there has started to be quite many buttons in the toolbar, not logged in users see less options. Also new users can quickly get started by copying from a read only example board. One reason is that logically user is switching a board, to sum these up, decision was to have two different locations.
