Sketchboard.Me starts to keep blog to give quick overview of features, news and thoughts. 
Technically blog is powered by Github, Jekyll and Twitter Boostrap. Blog is running on Github Pages that automatically 
publishes the blog on each git commit. First impression of Github Pages combined with Jekyll is great. It is really easy to use and 
very convinient. Setup makes possible to edit and publish blog content directly through a web browser by editing files through Github, which is extremly nice!
