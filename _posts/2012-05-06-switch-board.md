Switch board list enables you to quickly change a board. In case you want to have multiple boards open at the same time, press cmd/ctrl key 
while clicking the link, it opens the board to a new tab.

To change your board status to pro, click the left most empty box next to the board url. Pro boards can be recognized
from the green pro icon and are first in the list. Currently open board is highlighted with light grey background color. Boards that you are admin of are marked with **me** in the end of each line. You can change pro status only for those.
